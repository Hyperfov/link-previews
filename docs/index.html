      <h2>Page previews are great!</h2>
      <p>
        I find
        <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Page_Previews">page previews</a>
        are fantastic little piece of interactivity; they give insight into
        where a link leads before you click it. From poorly formed
        <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/writing-links/">link text</a>
        to sketchy URLs, there's plenty of reasons a bit more information might
        help before clicking into a new link. Outside of a few sites like
        <a
          href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2018/04/18/how-we-designed-page-previews-for-wikipedia/"
          >Wikipedia,</a

        >
        that have implemented previews for some internal links, they're
        relatively rare to see around the web.
      </p>

      <h3>Making global previews can be tricky</h3>

      <p>
        One key challenge—and why you likely don't often see previews for
        arbitrary links on webpages—is that fetching dynamic content from a
        different domain is
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS"
          >impossible from the browser</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Page previews are also often displayed as little popups that appear when
        a link is hovered, making them not particularly mobile-friendly. It's
        often considered a best practice to avoid hover events that aren't
        purely decorative, and unfortunately page previews fall into the
        category of non-decorative hover interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, when considering them a form of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement"
          >progressive enhancement</a
        >, they're certainly a very useful addition to pages when viewed on a
        desktop. I also don't think it's impossible to have page previews on
        mobile sites, but that's a design exploration for another day.
      </p>

      <h2>How these page previews work</h2>

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/cbroms/hyperfov-page-previews"
          >This package</a
        >
        is composed of two components:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A script that inserts page previews on a webpage, written as a
          <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a>
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components"
            >web component</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          A serverless worker function that fetches and serves the links' meta
          information, deployable on
          <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The serverless function is my solution to the aforementioned CORS
        problem; it does the work of requesting each link on behalf of the
        client. A script embedded in the page extracts links, sends them to the
        worker, then adds the preview popups when hovered.
      </p>

      <img
        src="images/diagram.png"
        alt="The webpage requests that the worker fetch the linked page, which the worker does and sends back to the webpage so it can display a page preview."
      />

      <p>
        This structure brings us closer to the goal of global page previews; now
        any arbitrary link on a page can be turned into a rich preview when
        hovered thanks to a helpful worker off-client.
      </p>

        More details are available on the
        <a href="https://github.com/cbroms/hyperfov-page-previews"
          >project's repository</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h3>Using it</h3>

      <p>
        This project is very much a work in progress, there'll still be lots of
        weirdness in use. There's a ton to consider to make these previews
        bulletproof for use on any website, so I'm starting small and mainly
        focusing on getting the package working for sites with static content,
        like this one.
      </p>

      <p>
        Style is another area of focus: page previews should feel integrated on
        any page. Every element in the preview popup can be styled with custom
        rules:
      </p>

      <div class="blocks">
        <a class="blocky" href="https://classicinterfaces.com">
          <p>Hover for default style.</p>
        </a>
        <a class="blocky" href="https://futureland.tv">
          <p>Hover for a link with custom style.</p>
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>

        I built this project as part of my
        <a href="https://twelvewebsites.com">Twelve Websites</a> project. I'm
        currently integrating it into my other sites and will be making
        adjustments as needed. Find a list of the improvements I'm planning on
